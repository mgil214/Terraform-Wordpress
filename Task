1.       Two VPCs (private & public) in a stage environment, two VPCs (private & public) in a prod environment,
         all in the same AWS account, already exist.
2.       Remote backend state in S3 with corresponding DynamoDB for state locking.
3.       Plain vanilla AMIs in use, no custom AMIs.
4.       Sensitive and non-sensitive variables are stored .tfvars files stored separately from the code.
Assumptions:
At a minimum, use Terraform to stand up as much as possible, and Ansible only when needed.
Need:
Problem:
Quick set of code to address the following infrastructure problem should be pretty straightforward:
Tools:
We donâ€™t need a perfect solution. This is more about a well-designed structure that is headed in the right direction.
We need an Linux EC2 instance to host a Wordpress web server (in both stage & prod).
The server needs to also support some static content that is stored in an EFS partition
that should be mounted to the EC2 instance via fstab. We also need CloudWatch logs/alarms
for monitoring load and accessibility (e.g., the operations team needs to be notified if
the host is out of resources, or is down for longer than 10 minutes.
